SONG 1
INNUENDO


One two three four

Ooh ooh

While the sun hangs in the sky and the desert has sand
While the waves crash in the sea and meet the land
While there's a wind and the stars and the rainbow
Till the mountains crumble into the plain

Oh yes, we'll keep on trying
Tread that fine line
Oh, we'll keep on trying
Yeah
Just passing our time

Oh oh

While we live according to race, colour or creed
While we rule by blind madness and pure greed
Our lives dictated by tradition, superstition, false religion
Through the eons and on and on

Oh, yes, we'll keep on trying, yeah
We'll tread that fine line
Oh oh we'll keep on trying
Till the end of time
Till the end of time

Through the sorrow all through our splendor
Don't take offence at my innuendo

Duh duh duh duh duh duh duh
Duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh

You can be anything you want to be
Just turn yourself into anything you think that you could ever be
Be free with your tempo, be free, be free
Surrender your ego be free, be free to yourself

Oh oh, yeah

If there's a God or any kind of justice under the sky
If there's a point, if there's a reason to live or die
Ha, if there's an answer to the questions we feel bound to ask
Show yourself destroy our fears release your mask
Oh yes, we'll keep on trying
Hey, tread that fine line
(Yeah) yeah
We'll keep on smiling, yeah
(Yeah) (yeah) (yeah)
And whatever will be will be
We'll just keep on trying
We'll just keep on trying
Till the end of time
Till the end of time
Till the end of time

SONG 3
DRIVEN BY YOU


Woh everything I do I do for you 
Ow
Oh yeah

We touch and you're afraid of me 
And we burn and now I'm at your feet 
High speed, but you know you're in safe hands 
Oh, in the dark we make a brighter light 
From one spark to the horizon wide 
We trust, and together we tame the land, yeah 

Oh you'd be forgiven if you think you're dreaming 
But we're working night and day to make a dream come true, yeah 
Everything I do is driven by you 
Oh, come on babe 

Oh well it's tough to make a journey through 
The right stuff is dead ahead of you and me 
And you know we still got time
Whoo, hold on tight to the driving wheel 
This ride is really out of line 
Raw deal, but there's no other that's worth a dime

You know I love you but you drive me crazy 
'Cause you're saying all the things I want to say to you
(You say) everything I do is driven by you 
Everything we do, oh yeah, everything we do 
Everything we do, everything we do 
Everything we do is driven by you

Inner children lost their way 
Now they know the price you pay 
I'm holding on to life with you 
'Cause life without you just won't do 

Driven by you 

Ah, you know we're never gonna know who's dreaming 
But we're working night and day to make the dream come true yeah
Everything I do is driven by you 
Everything we do, everything we do, everything we do
Yeah everything we do, everything we do, yeah everything we do 
Everything we do, everything we do, everything we do
Is driven by, driven by, driven by you

SONG 4
SOMEBODY TO LOVE


Can anybody find me somebody to love?

Ooh, each morning I get up I die a little
Can barely stand on my feet
(Take a look at yourself) Take a look in the mirror and cry (and cry)
Lord, what you're doing to me (yeah yeah)
I have spent all my years in believing you
But I just can't get no relief, Lord!
Somebody (somebody) ooh somebody (somebody)
Can anybody find me somebody to love?

I work hard (he works hard) every day of my life
I work 'til I ache in my bones
At the end (at the end of the day)
I take home my hard earned pay all on my own
I get down (down) on my knees (knees)
And I start to pray
'Til the tears run down from my eyes
Lord, somebody (somebody), ooh somebody
(Please) can anybody find me somebody to love?

(He works hard)
Everyday (everyday) I try and I try and I try
But everybody wants to put me down
They say I'm going crazy
They say I got a lot of water in my brain
Ah, got no common sense
I got nobody left to believe in
Yeah yeah yeah yeah

Oh, Lord
Ooh somebody, ooh somebody
Can anybody find me somebody to love?
(Can anybody find me someone to love)

Got no feel, I got no rhythm
I just keep losing my beat (you just keep losing and losing)
I'm OK, I'm alright (he's alright, he's alright)
I ain't gonna face no defeat (yeah yeah)
I just gotta get out of this prison cell
One day (someday) I'm gonna be free, Lord!

Find me somebody to love
Find me somebody to love
Find me somebody to love
Find me somebody to love
Find me somebody to love
Find me somebody to love
Find me somebody to love
Find me somebody to love love love

Yesterday my life was in ruin

Gotta feeling I should be doing all right

Jump in joy or sinking in sorrow

Now today God knows what I'm doing
Gotta feeling, I should be doing alright

SONG 7
KEEP YOURSELF ALIVE


Take off
I was told a million times
Of all the troubles in my way
Mind you grow a little wiser
Little better every day
But if I crossed a million rivers
And I rode a million miles
Then I'd still be where I started
Bread and butter for a smile
Well I sold a million mirrors
In a shopping alley way
But I never saw my face
In any window any day
Now they say your folks are telling you
Be a super star
But I tell you just be satisfied
Stay right where you are

Keep yourself alive, yeah
Keep yourself alive
Ooh, it'll take you all your time and money
Honey you'll survive

Ow

Well I've loved a million women
In a belladonic haze
And I ate a million dinners
Brought to me on silver trays
Give me everything I need
To feed my body and my soul
And I'll grow a little bigger
Maybe that can be my goal
I was told a million times
Of all the people in my way
How I had to keep on trying
And get better every day
But if I crossed a million rivers
And I rode a million miles
Then I'd still be where I started
Same as when I started

Keep yourself alive, come on
Keep yourself alive
Ooh, it'll take you all your time and money honey
You'll survive, shake

Ow
Keep yourself alive, wow
Keep yourself alive
Oh, it'll take you all your time and money
To keep me satisfied

Do you think you're better every day?
No, I just think I'm two steps nearer to my grave

Keep yourself alive, c'mon
Keep yourself alive
Mm, you take your time and take more money
Keep yourself alive
Keep yourself alive
C'mon keep yourself alive
All you people keep yourself alive
Keep yourself alive
C'mon c'mon keep yourself alive
It'll take you all your time and a money
To keep me satisfied
Keep yourself alive
Keep yourself alive
All you people keep yourself alive
Take you all your time and money honey
You will survive

Keep you satisfied




SONG 8
KILLER QUEEN


She keeps her Moet et Chandon
In her pretty cabinet
"Let them eat cake", she says
Just like Marie Antoinette
A built-in remedy
For Khrushchev and Kennedy
At anytime an invitation
You can't decline

Caviar and cigarettes
Well versed in etiquette
Extraordinarily nice

She's a Killer Queen
Gunpowder, gelatine
Dynamite with a laser beam
Guaranteed to blow your mind
Anytime

Recommended at the price
Insatiable an appetite
Wanna try?

To avoid complications
She never kept the same address
In conversation
She spoke just like a baroness
Met a man from China
Went down to Geisha Minah
Then again incidentally
If you're that way inclined

Perfume came naturally from Paris (naturally)
For cars she couldn't care less
Fastidious and precise

She's a Killer Queen
Gunpowder, gelatine
Dynamite with a laser beam
Guaranteed to blow your mind
Anytime

Drop of a hat she's as willing as
Playful as a pussy cat
Then momentarily out of action
Temporarily out of gas
To absolutely drive you wild, wild
She's all out to get you

She's a Killer Queen
Gunpowder, gelatine
Dynamite with a laser beam
Guaranteed to blow your mind
Anytime

Recommended at the price
Insatiable an appetite
Wanna try?
You wanna try

SONG 10
BOHEMIAN RHAPSODY [ALBUM VERSION]


Is this the real life?
Is this just fantasy?
Caught in a landslide
No escape from reality
Open your eyes
Look up to the skies and see
I'm just a poor boy
I need no sympathy
Because I'm easy come, easy go
Little high, little low
Any way the wind blows doesn't really matter to me, to me

Mama, just killed a man
Put a gun against his head
Pulled my trigger, now he's dead
Mama, life had just begun
But now I've gone and thrown it all away
Mama, ooh
Didn't mean to make you cry
If I'm not back again this time tomorrow
Carry on, carry on
As if nothing really matters

Too late, my time has come
Sends shivers down my spine
Body's aching all the time
Goodbye everybody, I've got to go
Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth
Mama, ooh (any way the wind blows)
I don't wanna die
I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all

I see a little silhouetto of a man
Scaramouche, Scaramouche, will you do the Fandango?
Thunderbolt and lightning very very frightening me
Gallileo, Gallileo
Gallileo, Gallileo
Gallileo Figaro, magnifico
I'm just a poor boy, nobody loves me
He's just a poor boy from a poor family
Spare him his life from this monstrosity
Easy come easy go, will you let me go?
Bismillah! No, we will not let you go (let him go)
Bismillah! We will not let you go (let him go)
Bismillah! We will not let you go (let me go)
Will not let you go (let me go)
Never, never, never, never let me go
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
Oh, mama mia, mama mia
Mama mia, let me go
Beelzebub has a devil put aside for me
For me
For me

So you think you can stone me and spit in my eye?
So you think you can love me and leave me to die?
Oh, baby
Can't do this to me, baby
Just gotta get out, just gotta get right outta here

(Ooh)
(Ooh yeah, ooh yeah)

Nothing really matters
Anyone can see
Nothing really matters
Nothing really matters to me

Any way the wind blows




SONG 11
NOW I'M HERE


Here I stand (here I stand)
Looked around, around, around, around, around
But you won't see me (but you won't see me)

Now I'm here (now I'm here)
Now I'm there (now I'm there)
I'm just a
Just a new man
Yes, you made me live again
Yeah!

A baby I was when you took my hand
The light of the night burned bright
The people all stared didn't understand
But you knew my name on sight

Ooh, whatever came of you and me
America's new bride to be
Don't worry babe, I'm safe and sound
Down in the dungeon just peaches and me

Don't I love you so
Yes, you made me live again
Come on! Everybody!

Yeah, ooh, a thin moon me in a smoke-screen sky
Where beams of your lovelight chase
Don't move, don't speak, don't feel no pain
With the rain running down my face

Your matches still light up the sky
And many a tear lives on in my eye

Down in the city just Hoople and me
Alright

Come on!

Whatever comes of you and me
I'd love to leave my memory with you

Now I'm here (now I'm here)
Think I'll stay around, around, around, around
Down in the city justa you and me

Aw yeah!




SONG 12
LOVE OF MY LIFE


Love of my life, you've hurt me
You've broken my heart and now you leave me
Love of my life, can't you see?
Bring it back, bring it back
Don't take it away from me, because you don't know
What it means to me

Love of my life, don't leave me
You've taken my love (all of my love) and now desert me
Love of my life, can't you see?
(Please bring it back) bring it back, bring it back (back)
Don't take it away from me (take it away from me)
Because you don't know (oh oh oh know means to me)
What it means to me

Who will remember
When this is blown over
And everything's all by the way (oh yeah)
When I grow older
I will be there at your side to remind you
How I still love you (I still love you)

Oh, back, hurry back
Please bring it back home to me
Because you don't know what it means to me
Love of my life
Love of my life
Oh, oh

SONG 14
ANOTHER ONE BITES THE DUST


Oh, let's go

Steve walks warily down the street
With the brim pulled way down low
Ain't no sound but the sound of his feet
Machine guns ready to go

Are you ready, hey, are you ready for this? 
Are you hanging on the edge of your seat? 
Out of the doorway the bullets rip
To the sound of the beat, yeah

Another one bites the dust
Another one bites the dust
And another one gone, and another one gone
Another one bites the dust
Hey, I'm gonna get you, too
Another one bites the dust

How do you think I'm going to get along
Without you when you're gone? 
You took me for everything that I had
And kicked me out on my own

Are you happy, are you satisfied? 
How long can you stand the heat? 
Out of the doorway the bullets rip
To the sound of the beat

Another one bites the dust
Another one bites the dust
And another one gone, and another one gone
Another one bites the dust
Hey, I'm gonna get you, too
Another one bites the dust

Hey
Oh, take it
Bite the dust
Kinda dusty

Hey

Another one bites the dust
Another one bites the dust, oww
Another one bites the dust, hey-hey
Another one bites the dust, eh-eh

Ooh, shout out
There are plenty of ways that you can hurt a man
And bring him to the ground
You can beat him, you can cheat him
You can treat him bad and leave him when he's down

But I'm ready, yes, I'm ready for you
I'm standing on my own two feet
Out of the doorway the bullets rip
Repeating to the sound of the beat oh yeah

Another one bites the dust
Another one bites the dust
And another one gone, and another one gone
Another one bites the dust, yeah
Hey, I'm gonna get you, too
Another one bites the dust

Ooh, shoot out
Hey-hey
All right

SONG 16
UNDER PRESSURE


Mmm num ba de
Dum bum ba be
Doo buh dum ba beh beh

Pressure pushing down on me
Pressing down on you, no man ask for
Under pressure that burns a building down
Splits a family in two
Puts people on streets

Um ba ba be
Um ba ba be
De day da
Ee day da, that's okay

It's the terror of knowing what the world is about
Watching some good friends screaming
"Let me out!"
Pray tomorrow gets me higher
Pressure on people, people on streets

Day day de mm hm
Da da da ba ba
Okay
Chipping around, kick my brains around the floor
These are the days it never rains but it pours
Ee do ba be
Ee da ba ba ba
Um bo bo
Be lap
People on streets
Ee da de da de
People on streets
Ee da de da de da de da

It's the terror of knowing what the world is about
Watching some good friends screaming
'Let me out'
Pray tomorrow gets me higher, high
Pressure on people, people on streets

Turned away from it all like a blind man
Sat on a fence but it don't work
Keep coming up with love but it's so slashed and torn
Why, why, why?
Love, love, love, love, love
Insanity laughs under pressure we're breaking

Can't we give ourselves one more chance?
Why can't we give love that one more chance?
Why can't we give love, give love, give love, give love
Give love, give love, give love, give love, give love?

'Cause love's such an old fashioned word
And love dares you to care for
The people on the edge of the night
And love (people on streets) dares you to change our way of
Caring about ourselves
This is our last dance
This is our last dance
This is ourselves under pressure
Under pressure
Pressure




SONG 17
WHO WANTS TO LIVE FOREVER


There's no time for us
There's no place for us
What is this thing that builds our dreams
Yet slips away from us?

Who wants to live forever?
Who wants to live forever?

There's no chance for us
It's all decided for us
This world has only one
Sweet moment set aside for us

Who wants to live forever?
Who wants to live forever?
Who?

Who dares to love forever
Oh, when love must die?

But touch my tears with your lips
Touch my world with your fingertips

And we can have forever
And we can love forever
Forever is our today

Who wants to live forever?
Who wants to live forever?
Forever is our today

Who waits forever anyway?




SONG 18
RADIO GA GA


I'd sit alone and watch your light
My only friend through teenage nights
And everything I had to know
I heard it on my radio

You gave them all those old time stars
Through wars of worlds invaded by Mars
You made 'em laugh, you made 'em cry
You made us feel like we could fly

So don't become some background noise
A backdrop for the girls and boys
Who just don't know or just don't care
And just complain when you're not there

You had your time, you had the power
You've yet to have your finest hour
Radio, everybody!

All we hear is radio ga ga
Radio goo goo
Radio ga ga
All we hear is radio ga ga
Radio blah blah
Radio, what's new?
Radio, someone still loves you

We watch the shows, we watch the stars
On videos for hours and hours
We hardly need to use our ears
How music changes through the years

Let's hope you never leave, old friend
Like all good things, on you we depend
So stick around 'cause we might miss you
When we grow tired of all this visual

Had your time, you had the power
You've yet to have your finest hour
Radio

All we hear is radio ga ga
Radio goo goo
Radio ga ga
All we hear is radio ga ga
Radio goo goo
Radio ga ga
All we hear is radio ga ga
Radio blah blah
Radio, what's new?
Radio, someone still loves you

Loves
You




SONG 19
HAMMER TO FALL [LIVE AID]


"Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Hammer To Fall"

Here we stand, here we fall
History don't care at all
Made the bed, light the light
Lady Mercy won't be home tonight

You don't waste no time at all
Don't hear the bell but you answer the call
It comes to you as to us all
Yeah, and it's time for the hammer to fall

Oh every night, and every day
A little piece of you is falling away
But lift your face the Western way
Build your

Tow the line and play their game
'Til the anesthetic covers it all
'Til one day they call your name
When it's time for the hammer to fall

Rich or poor or famous 
For your truth it's all the same
(Oh no, oh no)
Lock your door 'cause rain is pouring
Through your window pane
(Oh no)
Baby, now your trouble's all in vain, yeah

For you who grew up tall and proud
In the shadow of the mushroom cloud
Convinced our voices can't be heard
Just wanna scream it louder and louder and louder

What the hell are we fighting for?
Just surrender and it won't hurt at all
Just got time to say your prayers
Then it's time for the hammer to, hammer to fall

Yeah, to fall

Hey, hey
Hey, hey
Hey, yeah
One more time

Waiting for the hammer to fall

Give it to me one more time




SONG 20
WE ARE THE CHAMPIONS [SOUNDTRACK 2018]


I've paid my dues
Time after time
I've done my sentence
But committed no crime
And bad mistakes 
I've made a few
I've had my share of sand kicked in my face
But I've come through

We are the champions, my friends
And we'll keep on fighting 'til the end
We are the champions
We are the champions
No time for losers
'Cause we are the champions of the world

I've taken my bows
And my curtain calls
You brought me fame and fortune and everything that goes with it
I thank you all

But it's been no bed of roses
No pleasure cruise
I consider it a challenge before the whole human race

SONG 21
DON'T STOP ME NOW [REVISITED]


Tonight I'm gonna have myself 
A real good time
I feel alive
And the world
I'll turn it inside out, yeah
I'm floating around 
In ecstasy, so

Don't stop me now
Don't stop me
'Cause I'm havin' a good time
Havin' a good time

I'm a shooting star leaping through the sky
Like a tiger, defying the laws of gravity
I'm a racing car passing by
Like Lady Godiva
I'm gonna go, go, go
There's no stoppin' me

I'm burnin' through the sky, yeah
Two-hundred degrees
That's why they call me Mister Fahrenheit
I'm traveling at the speed of light
I wanna make a supersonic man out of you

Don't stop me now
I'm havin' such a good time
I'm havin' a ball
Don't stop me now
If you wanna have a good time
Just give me a call
Don't stop me now
'Cause I'm havin' a good time
Don't stop me now
Yes, I'm havin' a good time
I don't wanna stop at all, yeah

I'm a rocket ship on my way to Mars
On a collision course
I am a satellite
I'm out of control
I'm a sex machine ready to reload
Like an atom bomb
About to oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, explode

I'm burnin' through the sky, yeah
Two-hundred degrees
That's why they call me Mister Fahrenheit
I'm traveling at the speed of light
I wanna make a supersonic woman of you

Don't stop me, don't stop me, don't stop me
Hey, hey, hey
Don't stop me, don't stop me
Ooh, ooh, ooh, I like it
Don't stop me, don't stop me (alright)
Have a good time, good time
Don't stop me, don't stop me
Ahh

Alright

Oh, burnin' through the sky, yeah
Two-hundred degrees
That's why they call me Mister Fahrenheit
Hey, traveling at the speed of light
I wanna make a supersonic man out of you, yeah, yeah

Don't stop me now
I'm havin' such a good time
I'm havin' a ball
Don't stop me now
If you wanna have a good time

SONG 22
THE SHOW MUST GO ON


Empty spaces, what are we living for?
Abandoned places, I guess we know the score
On and on
Does anybody know what we are looking for?
Another hero, another mindless crime
Behind the curtain, in the pantomime
Hold the line
Does anybody want to take it anymore?

The show must go on
The show must go on
Yeah
Inside my heart is breaking
My make-up may be flaking
But my smile still stays on

Whatever happens, I'll leave it all to chance
Another heartache, another failed romance
On and on
Does anybody know what we are living for?
I guess I'm learning (I'm learning), I must be warmer now
I'll soon be turning (turning, turning, turning), 'round the corner now
Outside the dawn is breaking
But inside in the dark I'm aching to be free

The show must go on
The show must go on, yeah, yeah
Ooh, inside my heart is breaking
My make-up may be flaking
But my smile still stays on

Yeah, yeah
Oh, whoa, whoa
Oh, whoa

My soul is painted like the wings of butterflies
Fairy tales of yesterday will grow but never die
I can fly, my friends

The show must go on, yeah
The show must go on
I'll face it with a grin
I'm never givin' in
On with the show 

Ooh, I'll top the bill, I'll overkill
I have to find the will to carry on 
(On with the show, on with the show)
Show
(The show must go on, go on)

Pressing down on you no man ask for
Under pressure that brings a building down
Splits a family in two
Puts people on streets
Um ba ba be

Keep coming up with love but it's so slashed and torn
Why, why, why?
Love love love love love
Insanity laughs under pressure we're breaking
Can't we give ourselves one more chance
Why can't we give love that one more chance
Why can't we give love give love give love give love
Give love give love give love give love give love

'Cause love's such an old fashioned word
And love dares you to care for

And loves (people on streets) dares you to change our way of
Caring about ourselves

SONG 29
BRIGHTON ROCK


Happy little day, Jimmy went away
Met his little Jenny on a public holiday
A happy pair they made, so decorously laid
'Neath the gay illuminations all along the promenade
"It's so good to know there's still a little magic in the air
I'll weave my spell"

"Jenny will you stay, tarry with me pray
Nothing 'ere need come between us tell me love, what do you say?"
"Oh no I must away to my Mum in disarray
If my mother should discover how I spent my holiday
It would be of small avail to talk of magic in the air
I'll say farewell"

Oh Rock of Ages, do not crumble, love is breathing still
Oh Lady Moon, shine down a little people magic if you will

Jenny pines away, writes a letter everyday
"We must ever be together, nothing can my love erase"
"Oh no I'm compromised, I must apologize
If my lady should discover how I spent my holidays"

WE WILL ROCK YOU


Buddy, you're a boy, make a big noise
Playing in the street, gonna be a big man someday
You got mud on your face, you big disgrace
Kicking your can all over the place, singin'

We will, we will rock you
We will, we will rock you

Buddy, you're a young man, hard man
Shouting in the street, gonna take on the world someday
You got blood on your face, you big disgrace
Waving your banner all over the place

We will, we will rock you (sing it out)
We will, we will rock you

Buddy, you're an old man, poor man
Pleading with your eyes, gonna make you some peace someday
You got mud on your face, big disgrace
Somebody better put you back into your place

ANOTHER ONE BITES THE DUST


Oh, let's go

Steve walks warily down the street
With the brim pulled way down low
Ain't no sound but the sound of his feet
Machine guns ready to go

Are you ready, hey, are you ready for this? 
Are you hanging on the edge of your seat? 
Out of the doorway the bullets rip
To the sound of the beat, yeah

Another one bites the dust
Another one bites the dust
And another one gone, and another one gone
Another one bites the dust
Hey, I'm gonna get you, too
Another one bites the dust

How do you think I'm going to get along
Without you when you're gone? 
You took me for everything that I had
And kicked me out on my own

Are you happy, are you satisfied? 
How long can you stand the heat? 
Out of the doorway the bullets rip
To the sound of the beat

Another one bites the dust
Another one bites the dust
And another one gone, and another one gone
Another one bites the dust
Hey, I'm gonna get you, too
Another one bites the dust

Hey
Oh, take it
Bite the dust
Kinda dusty

Hey

Another one bites the dust
Another one bites the dust, oww
Another one bites the dust, hey-hey
Another one bites the dust, eh-eh

Ooh, shout out
There are plenty of ways that you can hurt a man
And bring him to the ground
You can beat him, you can cheat him
You can treat him bad and leave him when he's down

But I'm ready, yes, I'm ready for you
I'm standing on my own two feet
Out of the doorway the bullets rip
Repeating to the sound of the beat oh yeah

Another one bites the dust
Another one bites the dust
And another one gone, and another one gone
Another one bites the dust, yeah
Hey, I'm gonna get you, too
Another one bites the dust

Ooh, shoot out
Hey-hey
All right

RADIO GA GA


(Radio)
(Radio)
I'd sit alone and watch your light
My only friend through teenage nights
And everything I had to know
I heard it on my radio

You gave them all those old time stars
Through wars of worlds invaded by Mars
You made 'em laugh, you made 'em cry
You made us feel like we could fly (radio)

So don't become some background noise
A backdrop for the girls and boys
Who just don't know or just don't care
And just complain when you're not there

You had your time, you had the power
You've yet to have your finest hour
Radio (radio)

All we hear is radio ga ga
Radio goo goo
Radio ga ga
All we hear is radio ga ga
Radio blah blah
Radio, what's new?
Radio, someone still loves you

We watch the shows, we watch the stars
On videos for hours and hours
We hardly need to use our ears
How music changes through the years

Let's hope you never leave old friend
Like all good things on you we depend
So stick around 'cause we might miss you
When we grow tired of all this visual

You had your time, you had the power
You've yet to have your finest hour
Radio (radio)

All we hear is radio ga ga
Radio goo goo
Radio ga ga
All we hear is radio ga ga
Radio goo goo
Radio ga ga
All we hear is radio ga ga
Radio blah blah
Radio, what's new?
Someone still loves you

Radio ga ga 
Radio ga ga

You had your time, you had the power
You've yet to have your finest hour

Keep coming up with love but it's so slashed and torn
Why, why, why?

SONG 37
KILLER QUEEN


She keeps Moet et Chandon
In her pretty cabinet
"Let them eat cake", she says
Just like Marie Antoinette
A built-in remedy
For Khrushchev and Kennedy
At anytime an invitation
You can't decline

Caviar and cigarettes
Well versed in etiquette
Extraordinarily nice

She's a Killer Queen
Gunpowder, gelatine
Dynamite with a laser beam
Guaranteed to blow your mind
Anytime

Recommended at the price
Insatiable an appetite
Wanna try?

To avoid complications
She never kept the same address
In conversation
She spoke just like a baroness
Met a man from China
Went down to Geisha Minah
Then again incidentally
If you're that way inclined

Perfume came naturally from Paris
For cars she couldn't care less
Fastidious and precise

She's a Killer Queen
Gunpowder, gelatine
Dynamite with a laser beam
Guaranteed to blow your mind
Anytime

Drop of a hat she's as willing as
Playful as a pussy cat
Then momentarily out of action
Temporarily out of gas
To absolutely drive you wild, wild
She's all out to get you

She's a Killer Queen
Gunpowder, gelatine
Dynamite with a laser beam
Guaranteed to blow your mind
Anytime

Recommended at the price
Insatiable an appetite
Wanna try?
You wanna try

It's the terror of knowing what the world is about
Watching some good friends screaming
'Let me out'
Pray tomorrow gets me higher, high
Pressure on people, people on streets

Turned away from it all like a blind man
Sat on a fence but it don't work
Keep coming up with love but it's so slashed and torn
Why, why, why?
Love, love, love, love, love
Insanity laughs under pressure we're breaking

Can't we give ourselves one more chance?
Why can't we give love that one more chance?
Why can't we give love, give love, give love, give love
Give love, give love, give love, give love, give love?

'Cause love's such an old fashioned word
And love dares you to care for
The people on the edge of the night
And love (people on streets) dares you to change our way of
Caring about ourselves
This is our last dance
This is our last dance
This is ourselves under pressure
Under pressure
Pressure




SONG 41
UNDER PRESSURE


Mmm num ba de
Dum bum ba be
Doo buh dum ba beh beh

Pressure pushing down on me
Pressing down on you, no man ask for
Under pressure that burns a building down
Splits a family in two
Puts people on streets

Um ba ba be
Um ba ba be
De day da
Ee day da, that's okay

It's the terror of knowing what the world is about
Watching some good friends screaming
"Let me out!"
Pray tomorrow gets me higher
Pressure on people, people on streets

Day day de mm hm
Da da da ba ba
Okay
Chipping around, kick my brains around the floor
These are the days it never rains but it pours
Ee do ba be
Ee da ba ba ba
Um bo bo
Be lap
People on streets
Ee da de da de
People on streets
Ee da de da de da de da

It's the terror of knowing what the world is about
Watching some good friends screaming
'Let me out'
Pray tomorrow gets me higher, high
Pressure on people, people on streets

Turned away from it all like a blind man
Sat on a fence but it don't work
Keep coming up with love but it's so slashed and torn
Why, why, why?
Love, love, love, love, love
Insanity laughs under pressure we're breaking

Can't we give ourselves one more chance?
Why can't we give love that one more chance?
Why can't we give love, give love, give love, give love
Give love, give love, give love, give love, give love?

'Cause love's such an old fashioned word
And love dares you to care for
The people on the edge of the night
And love (people on streets) dares you to change our way of

SONG 42
THE GREAT PRETENDER


Oh yes, I'm the great pretender (ooh ooh)
Pretending I'm doing well (ooh ooh)
My need is such I pretend too much
I'm lonely but no one can tell

Oh yes I'm the great pretender (ooh ooh)
Adrift in a world of my own (ooh ooh)
I play the game but to my real shame
You've left me to dream all alone

Too real is this feeling of make believe
Too real when I feel what my heart can't conceal

Ooh ooh, yes I'm the great pretender (ooh ooh)
Just laughing and gay like a clown (ooh ooh)
I seem to be what I'm not (you see)
I'm wearing my heart like a crown
Pretending that you're still around

Yeah, ooh hoo
Too real when I feel what my heart can't conceal

Oh yes I'm the great pretender
Just laughing and gay like a clown (ooh ooh)
I seem to be what I'm not you see
I'm wearing my heart like a crown
Pretending that you're
Pretending that you're still around




SONG 43
MY FAIRY KING


Aah, aah
In the land where horses born with eagle wings
And honey bees have lost their stings
There's singing forever, ooh yeah
Lion's den with fallow deer
And rivers made from wine so clear
Flow on and on forever
Dragons fly like sparrows thru' the air
And baby lambs where Samson dares
To go on on on on on on

My fairy king can see things
He rules the air and turns the tides
That are not there for you and me
Ooh yeah he guides the winds
My fairy king can do right and nothing wrong

Ah, then came man to savage in the night
To run like thieves and to kill like knives
To take away the power from the magic hand
To bring about the ruin to the promised land, aah, aah

They turn the milk into sour
Like the blue in the blood of my veins
Why can't you see it
Fire burning in hell with the cry of screaming pain
Son of heaven set me free and let me go
Sea turn dry, no salt from sand
Seasons fly no helping hand
Teeth don't shine like pearls for poor man's eyes, aah

Someone, someone has drained the colour from my wings
Broken my fairy circle ring
And shamed the king in all his pride
Changed the winds and wronged the tides
Mother Mercury Mercury
Look what they've done to me
I cannot run, I cannot hide
La la la la la la la la la la la la




SONG 44
KEEP YOURSELF ALIVE


Take off
I was told a million times
Of all the troubles in my way
Mind you grow a little wiser
Little better every day
But if I crossed a million rivers
And I rode a million miles
Then I'd still be where I started
Bread and butter for a smile
Well I sold a million mirrors
In a shopping alley way
But I never saw my face
In any window any day
Now they say your folks are telling you
Be a super star
But I tell you just be satisfied
Stay right where you are

Keep yourself alive, yeah
Keep yourself alive
Ooh, it'll take you all your time and money
Honey you'll survive

Ow

Well I've loved a million women
In a belladonic haze
And I ate a million dinners
Brought to me on silver trays
Give me everything I need
To feed my body and my soul
And I'll grow a little bigger
Maybe that can be my goal
I was told a million times
Of all the people in my way
How I had to keep on trying
And get better every day
But if I crossed a million rivers
And I rode a million miles
Then I'd still be where I started
Same as when I started

Keep yourself alive, come on
Keep yourself alive
Ooh, it'll take you all your time and money honey
You'll survive, shake

Ow
Keep yourself alive, wow
Keep yourself alive
Oh, it'll take you all your time and money
To keep me satisfied

Do you think you're better every day?
No, I just think I'm two steps nearer to my grave

Keep yourself alive, c'mon
Keep yourself alive
Mm, you take your time and take more money
Keep yourself alive
Keep yourself alive
C'mon keep yourself alive
All you people keep yourself alive
Keep yourself alive
C'mon c'mon keep yourself alive
It'll take you all your time and a money
To keep me satisfied
Keep yourself alive

Take you all your time and money honey
You will survive

Gotta feeling I should be doing all right

Jump in joy or sinking in sorrow

SEE WHAT A FOOL I'VE BEEN


Well, she's gone, dear, gone this morning
See what a fool I've been
Oh Lord, what a fool I've been
Yes, I did too much

Didn't leave, didn't leave no letter
Didn't leave no warning (you naughty thing you)

SON AND DAUGHTER


I want you 
Woman

Tried to be a son and daughter rolled into one
You said you'd equal any man for having your fun

Ooh, now didn't you feel surprised to find
The cap just didn't fit?
The world expects a man
To buckle down and shovel shit
What'll you do for loving
When it's only just begun?
I want you to be a woman

Tried to be a teacher and a fisher of men
An equal people preacher
Will you lead us all the same?

Ooh, well I travelled around the world
And found a brand new word for day
Ooh, watching the time mustn't linger behind
Pardon me I have to get away
Ooh, what'll you think of heaven
If it's back from where you came

I want you to be a woman
I want you to be a woman, yeah

Ooh, you know I'm gonna save the world
Ooh, now I've just begun
Alright

OGRE BATTLE


Fa fa fa fa fa
Fa fa fa fa faa
Now once upon a time - an old man told me a fable
When the piper is gone - and the soup is cold on your table
And if the black crow flies to find a new destination
That is the sign
Come tonight
Come to the ogre sight
Come to the ogre-battle-fight

He gives a great big cry and he can swallow up the ocean
With a mighty tongue he catches flies - the palm of a hand incredible size
One great big eye - has a focus in your direction
Now the battle is on
Yeah yeah yeah
Come tonight
Come to the ogre sight
Come to the ogre-battle-fight

Fa fa fa fa faa
Hoooa

The ogre-men are still inside
The two-way mirror mountain
You gotta keep down right out of sight
You can't see in, but they can see out
"Ooh keep a look out"
The ogre-men are coming out
From the two-way mirror mountain
They're running up behind and they're coming all about
Can't go east 'cause you gotta go south

Aaargh
Aaaaaaaarghh
Ogre-men are going home
The great big fight is over
Bugle blow, let trumpet cry
Ogre battle lives for ever more - oh oh oh
You can come along
You can come along
Come to ogre battle
Fa fa fa fa faa

MODERN TIMES ROCK 'N' ROLL


Had to make do with a worn out rock and roll scene
The old bop is gettin' tired need a rest
Well you know what I mean
Fifty eight that was great
But it's over now and That's all
Somethin' harder's coming up
Gonna really knock a hole in the wall
Gonna hit ya grab you hard
Make you feel ten feet tall

Well I hope this baby's gonna come along soon
You don't know it could happen any ol' rainy afternoon
With the temperature down
And the jukebox blowin' no fuse
And my musical life's feelin'
Like a long Sunday School cruise
And you know there's one thing
Every single body could use
Yeah listen to me baby
Let me tell you what it's all about
Modern times rock and roll
Modern times rock and roll

Get you high heeled guitar boots and some groovy clothes
Get a hair piece on your chest
And a ring through your nose
Find a nice little man who says
He's gonna make you a real big star
Stars in your eyes and ants in your pants
Think you should go far
Everybody in this bum sucking world
Gonna know just who you are
Look out

Modern times rock and roll




SONG 53
GREAT KING RAT


Great King Rat died today
Born on the twenty first of May
Died syphilis forty four on his birthday
Every second word he swore
Yes he was the son of a whore
Always wanted by the law

Wouldn't you like to know?
Wouldn't you like to know people?
Great King Rat was a dirty old man
And a dirty old man was he
Now what did I tell you
Would you like to see?

Now hear this
Where will I be tomorrow? 
Will I beg ?, Will I borrow?
I don't care, I don't care anyway
Come on, come on the time is right
The man is evil and that is right
I told you ah yes I told you
And that's no lie, oh no no

Wouldn't you like to know?
Wouldn't you like to know?
Wouldn't you like to know?
Great King Rat was a dirty old man
And a dirty old man was he
Now what did I tell you
Would you like to see?
Show me

Oooh oooh oooh oooh
Wouldn't you like to know?
Wouldn't you like to know people people?
Great King Rat was a dirty old man
And a dirty old man was he
Now what did I tell you
Would you like to see?

Hit it

Now listen all you people
Put out the good and keep the bad
Don't believe all you read in the Bible
You sinners get in line
Saints you leave far behind
Very soon you're gonna be his disciple

Don't listen to what mama says
Not a word not a word mama says
Or else you'll find yourself being the rival
Sure, the great lord before he died
Knelt sinners by his side
And said you're going to realise tomorrow, oh woh oh woh oh woh

No I'm not going to tell you
What you already know
'Cause time and time again
The old man said it all a long time ago
Come on come on the time is right
This evil man will fight
I told you once before

Hear it
No

Wouldn't you like to know?
Wouldn't you like to know?
Just like I said before
Great King Rat was a dirty old man
And a dirty old man was he
The last time I tell you
Would you like to see?

NEVERMORE


There's no living in my life anymore
The seas have gone dry
And the rain's stopped falling
Please don't you cry any more
Can't you see
Listen to the breeze
Whisper to me please
Don't send me to the path of nevermore

Even the valley's below
Where the rays of the sun
Were so warm and tender
Now haven't anything to grow
Can't you see?
Why did you have to leave me? (nevermore)
Why did you deceive me? (nevermore)
You sent me to the path of nevermore
When you say you didn't love me anymore
Ah ah nevermore nevermore




SONG 57
WHITE QUEEN (AS IT BEGAN)


So sad her eyes
Smiling dark eyes
So sad her eyes
As it began

On such a breathless night as this
Upon my brow the lightest kiss
I walked alone
And all around the air did say
My lady soon will stir this way
In sorrow known
The white queen walks and
The night grows pale
Stars of lovingmess in her hair

Needing - unheard
Pleading - one word
So sad my eyes
She cannot see

How did thee fare, what have thee seen
The mother of the willow green
I call her name
And ?neath her window have I stayed
I loved the footsteps that she made
And when she came
White queen how my heart did ache
And dry my lips no word would make
So still I wait

My goddess hear my darkest fear
I speak too late
It?s for evermore that I wait

Dear friend goodbye
No tear in my eyes
So sad it ends
As it began




SONG 58
NOW I'M HERE


Here I stand (here I stand)
Looked around, around, around, around, around
But you won't see me (but you won't see me)

Now I'm here (now I'm here)
Now I'm there (now I'm there)
I'm just a
Just a new man
Yes, you made me live again
Yeah!

A baby I was when you took my hand
The light of the night burned bright
The people all stared didn't understand
But you knew my name on sight

Ooh, whatever came of you and me
America's new bride to be
Don't worry babe, I'm safe and sound
Down in the dungeon just peaches and me

Don't I love you so
Yes, you made me live again
Come on! Everybody!

Yeah, ooh, a thin moon me in a smoke-screen sky
Where beams of your lovelight chase
Don't move, don't speak, don't feel no pain
With the rain running down my face

Your matches still light up the sky
And many a tear lives on in my eye

Down in the city just Hoople and me
Alright

Come on!

Whatever comes of you and me
I'd love to leave my memory with you

Now I'm here (now I'm here)
Think I'll stay around, around, around, around
Down in the city justa you and me

Aw yeah!




SONG 59
STONE COLD CRAZY


Sleeping very soundly
On a Saturday morning
I was dreaming I was Al Capone
There's a rumor going round
Gotta clear outta town
I'm smelling like a dry-fish bone

Here come the Law
Gonna break down the door
Gonna carry me away once more
Never, I never
I never want it any more
Gotta get away from this stone-cold floor

Crazy
Stone-cold crazy, you know

Rainy afternoon
I gotta blow a typhoon
And I'm playing on my slide trombone
Anymore, anymore
Cannot take it anymore
Gotta get away from this stone-cold floor

Crazy
Stone-cold crazy, you know

Hit 'em up

Walking down the street
Shooting people that I meet
With my rubber Tommy water gun
Here come the deputy
He's gonna come and get a me
I gotta get me get up and run

They got the sirens loose
I ran right out of juice
They're gonna put me in a cell
If I can't go to heaven
Will they let me go to hell?

Crazy
Stone-cold crazy, you know




SONG 60
FLICK OF THE WRIST


Dislocate your spine if you don't sign he says
I'll have you seeing double (double)
Mesmerize you when he's tongue-tied
Simply with those eyes, ooh ooh ooh
Synchronize your minds and see
The beast within him rise

Don't look back
Don't look back
It's a rip-off
Flick of the wrist and you're dead baby
Blow him a kiss and you're mad, ooh ooh ooh ooh
Flick of the wrist he'll eat your heart out
A dig in the ribs and then a kick in the head
He's taken an arm and taken a leg
All this time honey
Baby you've been had

Intoxicate your brain with what I'm saying
If not you'll lie in knee-deep trouble
Prostitute yourself he says
Castrate your human pride, ooh ooh ooh
Sacrifice your leisure days
Let me squeeze you till you've dried

Don't look back
Don't look back
It's a rip-off, aah, aah, aah

Work my fingers to my bones
I scream with pain
I still make no impression
Seduce you with his money-make machine
Cross-collateralize, (big-time money money)
Reduce you to a muzak-fake machine
Then the last goodbye
It's a rip-off

Flick of the wrist and you're dead baby
Blow him a kiss and you're mad, ooh ooh ooh ooh
Flick of the wrist he'll eat your heart out
A dig in the ribs and then a kick in the head
He's taken an arm, and taken a leg
All this time honey
Baby you've been had




SONG 61
TENEMENT FUNSTER


My new purple shoes
Been amazin' the people next door
And my rock 'n roll forty fives
Been enragin' the folks on the lower floor

I got a way with the girls on my block
Try my best to be a real individual
And when we go down to smokies and rock
They line up like it's some kind of ritual
Oh give me a good guitar
And you can say that my hair's a disgrace
Or just find me an open car
I'll make the speed of light outta this place

I like the good things in life
But most of the best things ain't free
It's the same situation just cuts like a knife
When you're young and you're poor and you're crazy
Young and you're crazy...

Oh give me a good guitar
And you can say that my hair's a disgrace
Or just find me an open car
I'll make the speed of light outta this place

SONG 64
SPREAD YOUR WINGS


Sammy was low
Just watching the show
Over and over again
Knew it was time
He'd made up his mind
To leave his dead life behind
His boss said to him
Boy you'd better begin
To get those crazy notions right out of your head
Sammy who do you think that you are
You should've been sweeping up the Emerald bar

Spread your wings and fly away
Fly away far away
Spread your little wings and fly away
Fly away far away
Pull yourself together
'Cause you know you should do better
That's because you're a free man

He spends his evenings alone in his hotel room
Keeping his thoughts to himself he'd be leaving soon
Wishing he was miles and miles away
Nothing in this world nothing would make him stay

Since he was small
Had no luck at all
Nothing came easy to him
Now it was time
He'd made up his mind
This could be my last chance

His boss said to him now listen boy
You're always dreaming
You've got no real ambition you won't get very far
Sammy boy don't you know who you are
Why can't you be happy at the Emerald bar

So honey
Spread your wings and fly away
Fly away far away
Spread your little wings and fly away
Fly away far away
Pull yourself together
'Cause you know you should do better
That's because you're a free man
Come on honey




SONG 65
IT'S LATE


You say you love me
And I hardly know your name
And if I say I love you in the candle light
There's no one but myself to blame
But there's something inside
That's turning my mind away
Whoa, how I could love you
If I could let you stay

It's late, and I'm bleeding deep inside
It's late, ooh, is it just my sickly pride?
Too late, even now the feeling seems to steal away
So late, though I'm crying I can't help but hear you say
It's late, it's late, it's late
But not too late

Mm, yeah
The way you love me
Is the sweetest love around
But after all this time
The more I'm trying
The more I seem to let you down, yes
Now you tell me you're leaving
And I just can't believe it's true
Oh, you know that I can love you
Though I know I can't be true
Oh, you made me love you
Don't tell me that we're through

It's late, mm, and it's driving me so mad
It's late, yes I know, but don't try to tell me that it's
Too late, save our love you can't turn out the light
So late, I've been wrong but I'll learn to be right
It's late, it's late, it's late
But not too late

Mm, I've been so long
You've been so long
We've been so long tryin' to work it out
I ain't got long
You ain't got long
We've gotta know what this life's all about, ooh
Tell me

Tryin' to work it out, yeah, ooh
Ooh too late
Yeah, too late
Much too late, ah

You're staring at me
With suspicion in your eye
You say what game are you playing?
What's this that you're saying?
I know that I can't reply
If I take you tonight
Is it making my life a lie?
Oh you make me wonder
Did I live my life right?

It's late, ooh, but it's time to set me free
It's late, ooh, yes I know, but there's no way it has to be
Too late, so let the fire take our bodies this night
So late, let the waters take our guilt in the tide
It's late, it's late, it's late, it's late
It's late, it's late, it's late
Oh, It's all too late

Whoa, whoa, come on
Ooh mm, late, too late, oh yeah
Ah




SONG 66
MY MELANCHOLY BLUES


Another party is over
And I'm left cold sober
Baby left me for somebody new
I don't wanna talk about it
Want to forget about it
Wanna be intoxicated with that special brew
So come and get me
Let me
Get in that sinking feeling
That says my heart is on an all time low, so
Don't expect me
To behave perfectly
And wear that sunny smile
My guess is I'm in for a cloudy and overcast
Don't try and stop me
'Cause I'm heading for that stormy weather soon
I'm causing a mild sensation
With this new occupation
I'm permanently glued
To this extraordinary mood, so now move over
And let me take over
With my melancholy blues

I'm causing a mild sensation
With this new occupation
I'm in the news
I'm just getting used to my new exposure
Come into my enclosure
And meet my melancholy blues




SONG 67
KEEP YOURSELF ALIVE


Take off
I was told a million times
Of all the troubles in my way
Mind you grow a little wiser
Little better every day
But if I crossed a million rivers
And I rode a million miles
Then I'd still be where I started
Bread and butter for a smile
Well I sold a million mirrors
In a shopping alley way
But I never saw my face
In any window any day
Now they say your folks are telling you
Be a super star
But I tell you just be satisfied
Stay right where you are

Keep yourself alive, yeah
Keep yourself alive
Ooh, it'll take you all your time and money
Honey you'll survive

Ow

Well I've loved a million women
In a belladonic haze
And I ate a million dinners
Brought to me on silver trays
Give me everything I need
To feed my body and my soul
And I'll grow a little bigger
Maybe that can be my goal
I was told a million times
Of all the people in my way
How I had to keep on trying
And get better every day
But if I crossed a million rivers
And I rode a million miles
Then I'd still be where I started
Same as when I started

Keep yourself alive, come on
Keep yourself alive
Ooh, it'll take you all your time and money honey
You'll survive, shake

Ow
Keep yourself alive, wow
Keep yourself alive
Oh, it'll take you all your time and money
To keep me satisfied

Do you think you're better every day?
No, I just think I'm two steps nearer to my grave

Keep yourself alive, c'mon
Keep yourself alive
Mm, you take your time and take more money
Keep yourself alive
Keep yourself alive
C'mon keep yourself alive
All you people keep yourself alive
Keep yourself alive
C'mon c'mon keep yourself alive
It'll take you all your time and a money
To keep me satisfied
Keep yourself alive
Keep yourself alive
All you people keep yourself alive
Take you all your time and money honey
You will survive

Keep you satisfied

Jump in joy or sinking in sorrow

SEE WHAT A FOOL I'VE BEEN


Well, she's gone, dear, gone this morning
See what a fool I've been
Oh Lord, what a fool I've been
Yes, I did too much

Didn't leave, didn't leave no letter
Didn't leave no warning (you naughty thing you)
I guess I'm all to blame, oh Lord
I guess I'm all to blame (see you later... right now you)
Take it

My little dog ain't too hungry, no, no; he just kept on barking 
Viciously
Just don't seem the same, oh, no, no
It just don't seem the same (oh, see you later)

Now hit it like that
Coming on strong

Well, I got so lonely
Went and told my neighbor
She said, "mm, mm, mm, mm, mm."
Oh Lord, what a fool I've been
And she told me what to do
She said, "go home."

Well, she's gone, gone this morning
See what a fool I've been, oh Lord
What a fool I've been




SONG 71
SON AND DAUGHTER


I want you 
Woman

Tried to be a son and daughter rolled into one
You said you'd equal any man for having your fun

Ooh, now didn't you feel surprised to find
The cap just didn't fit?
The world expects a man
To buckle down and shovel shit
What'll you do for loving
When it's only just begun?
I want you to be a woman

Tried to be a teacher and a fisher of men
An equal people preacher
Will you lead us all the same?

Ooh, well I travelled around the world
And found a brand new word for day
Ooh, watching the time mustn't linger behind
Pardon me I have to get away
Ooh, what'll you think of heaven
If it's back from where you came

I want you to be a woman
I want you to be a woman, yeah

Ooh, you know I'm gonna save the world
Ooh, now I've just begun
Alright

OGRE BATTLE


Fa fa fa fa fa
Fa fa fa fa faa
Now once upon a time - an old man told me a fable
When the piper is gone - and the soup is cold on your table
And if the black crow flies to find a new destination
That is the sign
Come tonight
Come to the ogre sight
Come to the ogre-battle-fight

He gives a great big cry and he can swallow up the ocean
With a mighty tongue he catches flies - the palm of a hand incredible size
One great big eye - has a focus in your direction
Now the battle is on
Yeah yeah yeah
Come tonight
Come to the ogre sight
Come to the ogre-battle-fight

Fa fa fa fa faa
Hoooa

The ogre-men are still inside
The two-way mirror mountain
You gotta keep down right out of sight
You can't see in, but they can see out
"Ooh keep a look out"
The ogre-men are coming out
From the two-way mirror mountain
They're running up behind and they're coming all about
Can't go east 'cause you gotta go south

Aaargh
Aaaaaaaarghh
Ogre-men are going home
The great big fight is over
Bugle blow, let trumpet cry
Ogre battle lives for ever more - oh oh oh
You can come along
You can come along
Come to ogre battle
Fa fa fa fa faa

MODERN TIMES ROCK'N'ROLL


Had to make do with a worn out rock and roll scene
The old bop is gettin' tired need a rest
Well you know what I mean
Fifty eight that was great
But it's over now and that's all
Somethin' harder's coming up
Gonna really knock a hole in the wall
Gonna hit ya grab you hard
Make you feel ten feet tall

Well I hope that big new baby's gonna come along soon
You don't know it could happen any ol' rainy afternoon
With the temp'rature down
And the juke box blowin' no fuse
And my musical life's feelin'
Like a long Sunday School cruise
And you know there's one thing
Every single body could use
Yeah listen to me baby
Let me tell you what it's all about
Modern times rock and roll
Modern times rock and roll

Get your high heeled guitar boots and some groovy clothes
Get a hair piece on your chest
And a ring through your nose
Find a nice little man who says
He's gonna make you a real big star
Stars in your eyes ants in your pants
Think you should go far
Everybody in this bum sucking world's
Gonna know just who you are
Look out

Modern times rock and roll




SONG 74
GREAT KING RAT


Great King Rat died today
Born on the twenty first of May
Died syphilis forty four on his birthday
Every second word he swore
Yes he was the son of a whore
Always wanted by the law

Wouldn't you like to know?
Wouldn't you like to know people?
Great King Rat was a dirty old man
And a dirty old man was he
Now what did I tell you
Would you like to see?

Now hear this
Where will I be tomorrow? 
Will I beg ?, Will I borrow?
I don't care, I don't care anyway
Come on, come on the time is right
The man is evil and that is right
I told you ah yes I told you
And that's no lie, oh no no

Wouldn't you like to know?
Wouldn't you like to know?
Wouldn't you like to know?
Great King Rat was a dirty old man
And a dirty old man was he
Now what did I tell you
Would you like to see?
Show me

Oooh oooh oooh oooh
Wouldn't you like to know?
Wouldn't you like to know people people?
Great King Rat was a dirty old man
And a dirty old man was he
Now what did I tell you
Would you like to see?

Hit it

Now listen all you people
Put out the good and keep the bad
Don't believe all you read in the Bible
You sinners get in line
Saints you leave far behind
Very soon you're gonna be his disciple

Don't listen to what mama says
Not a word not a word mama says
Or else you'll find yourself being the rival
Sure, the great lord before he died
Knelt sinners by his side
And said you're going to realise tomorrow, oh woh oh woh oh woh

No I'm not going to tell you
What you already know
'Cause time and time again
The old man said it all a long time ago
Come on come on the time is right
This evil man will fight
I told you once before

Hear it
No

Wouldn't you like to know?
Wouldn't you like to know?
Just like I said before
Great King Rat was a dirty old man
And a dirty old man was he
The last time I tell you
Would you like to see?




SONG 75
NEVERMORE


There's no living in my life anymore
The seas have gone dry
And the rain's stopped falling
Please don't you cry any more
Can't you see
Listen to the breeze
Whisper to me please
Don't send me to the path of nevermore

Even the valley's below
Where the rays of the sun
Were so warm and tender
Now haven't anything to grow
Can't you see?
Why did you have to leave me? (nevermore)
Why did you deceive me? (nevermore)
You sent me to the path of nevermore
When you say you didn't love me anymore
Ah ah nevermore nevermore




SONG 76
WHITE QUEEN (AS IT BEGAN)


So sad her eyes
Smiling dark eyes
So sad her eyes
As it began

On such a breathless night as this
Upon my brow the lightest kiss
I walked alone
And all around the air did say
My lady soon will stir this way
In sorrow known
The white queen walks and
The night grows pale
Stars of lovingmess in her hair

Needing - unheard
Pleading - one word
So sad my eyes
She cannot see

How did thee fare, what have thee seen
The mother of the willow green
I call her name
And ?neath her window have I stayed
I loved the footsteps that she made
And when she came
White queen how my heart did ache
And dry my lips no word would make
So still I wait

My goddess hear my darkest fear
I speak too late
It?s for evermore that I wait

Dear friend goodbye
No tear in my eyes
So sad it ends
As it began




SONG 77
NOW I'M HERE


Here I stand (here I stand)
Looked around, around, around, around, around
But you won't see me (but you won't see me)

Now I'm here (now I'm here)
Now I'm there (now I'm there)
I'm just a
Just a new man
Yes, you made me live again
Yeah!

A baby I was when you took my hand
The light of the night burned bright
The people all stared didn't understand
But you knew my name on sight

Ooh, whatever came of you and me
America's new bride to be
Don't worry babe, I'm safe and sound
Down in the dungeon just peaches and me

Don't I love you so
Yes, you made me live again
Come on! Everybody!

Yeah, ooh, a thin moon me in a smoke-screen sky
Where beams of your lovelight chase
Don't move, don't speak, don't feel no pain
With the rain running down my face

Your matches still light up the sky
And many a tear lives on in my eye

Down in the city just Hoople and me
Alright

Come on!

Whatever comes of you and me
I'd love to leave my memory with you

Now I'm here (now I'm here)
Think I'll stay around, around, around, around
Down in the city justa you and me

Aw yeah!




SONG 78
STONE COLD CRAZY


Sleeping very soundly
On a Saturday morning
I was dreaming I was Al Capone
There's a rumor going round
Gotta clear outta town
I'm smelling like a dry-fish bone

Here come the Law
Gonna break down the door
Gonna carry me away once more
Never, I never
I never want it any more
Gotta get away from this stone-cold floor

Crazy
Stone-cold crazy, you know

Rainy afternoon
I gotta blow a typhoon
And I'm playing on my slide trombone
Anymore, anymore
Cannot take it anymore
Gotta get away from this stone-cold floor

Crazy
Stone-cold crazy, you know

Hit 'em up

Walking down the street
Shooting people that I meet
With my rubber Tommy water gun
Here come the deputy
He's gonna come and get a me
I gotta get me get up and run

They got the sirens loose
I ran right out of juice
They're gonna put me in a cell
If I can't go to heaven
Will they let me go to hell?

Crazy
Stone-cold crazy, you know




SONG 79
FLICK OF THE WRIST


Dislocate your spine if you don't sign he says
I'll have you seeing double (double)
Mesmerize you when he's tongue-tied
Simply with those eyes, ooh ooh ooh
Synchronize your minds and see
The beast within him rise

Don't look back
Don't look back
It's a rip-off
Flick of the wrist and you're dead baby
Blow him a kiss and you're mad, ooh ooh ooh ooh
Flick of the wrist he'll eat your heart out
A dig in the ribs and then a kick in the head
He's taken an arm and taken a leg
All this time honey
Baby you've been had

Intoxicate your brain with what I'm saying
If not you'll lie in knee-deep trouble
Prostitute yourself he says
Castrate your human pride, ooh ooh ooh
Sacrifice your leisure days
Let me squeeze you till you've dried

Don't look back
Don't look back
It's a rip-off, aah, aah, aah

Work my fingers to my bones
I scream with pain
I still make no impression
Seduce you with his money-make machine
Cross-collateralize, (big-time money money)
Reduce you to a muzak-fake machine
Then the last goodbye
It's a rip-off

Flick of the wrist and you're dead baby
Blow him a kiss and you're mad, ooh ooh ooh ooh
Flick of the wrist he'll eat your heart out
A dig in the ribs and then a kick in the head
He's taken an arm, and taken a leg
All this time honey
Baby you've been had




SONG 80
TENEMENT FUNSTER


My new purple shoes
Been amazin' the people next door
And my rock 'n roll forty fives
Been enragin' the folks on the lower floor

I got a way with the girls on my block
Try my best to be a real individual
And when we go down to smokies and rock
They line up like it's some kind of ritual
Oh give me a good guitar
And you can say that my hair's a disgrace
Or just find me an open car
I'll make the speed of light outta this place

I like the good things in life
But most of the best things ain't free
It's the same situation just cuts like a knife
When you're young and you're poor and you're crazy
Young and you're crazy...

Oh give me a good guitar
And you can say that my hair's a disgrace
Or just find me an open car
I'll make the speed of light outta this place




SONG 81

To leave his dead life behind

Boy you'd better begin
To get those crazy notions right out of your head

FATHER TO SON


A word in your ear, from father to son
Hear the word that I say
I fought with you, fought on your side
Long before you were born

Joyful the sound, the word goes around
From father to son, to son...
And the voice is so clear, time after time it keeps on
Calling you, calling you on
Don't destroy what you see, your country to be
Just keep building on the ground that's been won

Kings will be crowned, and the word goes around
From father to son, to son

Won't you hear us sing
(te de de de de de de de de de de de de de de)
Our family song
(te de de de de de de de de de de de de de de)

Father, father, father, father, ooh yeah, father, father, father, father

Now we hand it on
But I've heard it all before

Take this letter that I give you
Take it sonny, hold it high
You won't understand a word that's in it
But you'll write it out again before you die (yeah yeah)

A word in your ear from father to son
Funny you don't hear a single word I say
But my letter to you will stay by your side
Through the years till the loneliness is gone
Sing if you will - but the air you breathe I live to give you

Father to son, father to, father to, father to son

Joyful the sound, the word goes around
From father to son, to son...

Kings will be crowned, the word goes around
From father to son, to son

Joyful the sound, the word goes around
From father to son, to son...

Kings will be crowned, the word goes around
From father to son, to son

Joyful the sound, the word goes around
From father to son, to son...

Kings will be crowned, the word goes around
From father to son, to son

Joyful the sound, the word goes around





SONG 87
OGRE BATTLE


Fa fa fa fa fa
Fa fa fa fa faa
Now once upon a time - an old man told me a fable
When the piper is gone - and the soup is cold on your table
And if the black crow flies to find a new destination
That is the sign
Come tonight
Come to the ogre sight
Come to the ogre-battle-fight

He gives a great big cry and he can swallow up the ocean
With a mighty tongue he catches flies - the palm of a hand incredible size
One great big eye - has a focus in your direction
Now the battle is on
Yeah yeah yeah
Come tonight
Come to the ogre sight
Come to the ogre-battle-fight

Fa fa fa fa faa
Hoooa

The ogre-men are still inside
The two-way mirror mountain
You gotta keep down right out of sight
You can't see in, but they can see out
"Ooh keep a look out"
The ogre-men are coming out
From the two-way mirror mountain
They're running up behind and they're coming all about
Can't go east 'cause you gotta go south

Aaargh
Aaaaaaaarghh
Ogre-men are going home
The great big fight is over
Bugle blow, let trumpet cry
Ogre battle lives for ever more - oh oh oh
You can come along
You can come along
Come to ogre battle
Fa fa fa fa faa

SONG 89
JAILHOUSE ROCK


The warden threw a party in the county jail.
The prison band was there and they began to wail.
The band was jumpin' and the joint began to swing.
You should've heard those knocked out jailbirds sing.

[Chorus]
Let's rock, everybody, let's rock.
Everybody in the whole cell block
was dancin' to the Jailhouse Rock.

Spider Murphy played the tenor saxophone,
Little Joe was blowin' on the slide trombone.
The drummer boy from Illinois went crash, boom, bang,
the whole rhythm section was the Purple Gang.

[Chorus]

Number forty-seven said to number three
"You're the cutest jailbird I ever did see.
I sure would be delighted with your company,
come on and do the Jailhouse Rock with me."

[Chorus]

The sad sack was a sittin' on a block of stone
way over in the corner weepin' all alone.
The warden said, "Hey, buddy, don't you be no square.
If you can't find a partner use a wooden chair."

[Chorus]

Shifty Henry said to Bugs, "For Heaven's sake,
no one's lookin', now's our chance to make a break."
Bugsy turned to Shifty and he said, "Nix nix,
I wanna stick around a while and get my kicks."

[Chorus]

A baby I was when you took my hand
The light of the night burned bright
The people all stared didn't understand
But you knew my name on sight

Ooh, whatever came of you and me
America's new bride to be
Don't worry babe, I'm safe and sound
Down in the dungeon just peaches and me

Don't I love you so
Yes, you made me live again
Come on! Everybody!

Yeah, ooh, a thin moon me in a smoke-screen sky
Where beams of your lovelight chase
Don't move, don't speak, don't feel no pain
With the rain running down my face

Your matches still light up the sky
And many a tear lives on in my eye

Down in the city just Hoople and me
Alright

Come on!

Whatever comes of you and me
I'd love to leave my memory with you

Now I'm here (now I'm here)
Think I'll stay around, around, around, around
Down in the city justa you and me

LOVE OF MY LIFE


Love of my life, you've hurt me
You've broken my heart and now you leave me
Love of my life, can't you see?
Bring it back, bring it back
Don't take it away from me, because you don't know
What it means to me

Love of my life, don't leave me
You've taken my love (all of my love) and now desert me
Love of my life, can't you see?
(Please bring it back) bring it back, bring it back (back)
Don't take it away from me (take it away from me)
Because you don't know (oh oh oh know means to me)
What it means to me

Who will remember

And everything's all by the way (oh yeah)
When I grow older
I will be there at your side to remind you
How I still love you (I still love you)

Oh, back, hurry back
Please bring it back home to me
Because you don't know what it means to me
Love of my life
Love of my life

SONG 93
A KIND OF MAGIC


(It's a kind of magic)
(It's a kind of magic)
(A kind of magic)

One dream, one soul, one prize, one goal
One golden glance of what should be
(It's a kind of magic)
One shaft of light that shows the way
No mortal man can win this day

(It's a kind of magic)
The bell that rings inside your mind
It's a challenging the doors of time
(It's a kind of magic)

The waiting seems eternity
The day will dawn of sanity
It's a kind of magic
(It's a kind of magic)
There can be only one

This rage that lasts a thousand years
Will soon be gone
This flame that burns inside of me
I'm hearing secret harmonies

(It's a kind of magic)
The bell that rings inside your mind
Is challenging the doors of time
(It's a kind of magic)
(It's a kind of magic)

This rage that lasts a thousand years
Will soon be, will soon be
Will soon be gone

This is a kind of magic
There can only be one
This rage that lasts a thousand years
Will soon be gone (gone)

Magic, it's a kind of magic
It's a kind of magic
Magic, magic, magic, magic
Magic, ha ha ha ha it's magic

Ha ha
Yeah, yeah

It's a kind of magic




SONG 94
UNDER PRESSURE


Mm ba ba de
Um bum ba de
Um bu bu bum da de

Pressure pushing down on me
Pressing down on you no man ask for
Under pressure that brings a building down
Splits a family in two
Puts people on streets
Um ba ba be
Um ba ba be
De day da
Ee day da that's okay

It's the terror of knowing
What the world is about
Watching some good friends
Screaming Let me out
Pray tomorrow gets me higher
Pressure on people people on streets
Day day de mm hm
Da da da ba ba
Okay

Chippin' around kick my brains around the floor
These are the days it never rains but it pours
Ee do ba be
Ee da ba ba ba
Um bo bo
Be lap
People on streets ee da de da de
People on streets ee da de da de da de da

It's the terror of knowing
What this world is about
Watching some good friends
Screaming let me out
Pray tomorrow gets me higher higher high
Pressure on people people on streets

Turned away from it all like a blind man
Sat on a fence but it don't work
Keep coming up with love but it's so slashed and torn
Why, why, why?
Love love love love love
Insanity laughs under pressure we're breaking
Can't we give ourselves one more chance
Why can't we give love that one more chance
Why can't we give love give love give love give love
Give love give love give love give love give love

'Cause love's such an old fashioned word
And love dares you to care for
The people on the (people on streets) edge of the night
And loves (people on streets) dares you to change our way of
Caring about ourselves
This is our last dance
This is ourselves
Under pressure
Under pressure
Pressure




SONG 95
MY FAIRY KING


Aah, aah
In the land where horses born with eagle wings
And honey bees have lost their stings
There's singing forever, ooh yeah
Lion's den with fallow deer
And rivers made from wine so clear
Flow on and on forever
Dragons fly like sparrows thru' the air
And baby lambs where Samson dares
To go on on on on on on

My fairy king can see things
He rules the air and turns the tides
That are not there for you and me
Ooh yeah he guides the winds
My fairy king can do right and nothing wrong

Ah, then came man to savage in the night
To run like thieves and to kill like knives
To take away the power from the magic hand
To bring about the ruin to the promised land, aah, aah

They turn the milk into sour
Like the blue in the blood of my veins
Why can't you see it
Fire burning in hell with the cry of screaming pain
Son of heaven set me free and let me go
Sea turn dry, no salt from sand
Seasons fly no helping hand
Teeth don't shine like pearls for poor man's eyes, aah

Someone, someone has drained the colour from my wings
Broken my fairy circle ring
And shamed the king in all his pride
Changed the winds and wronged the tides
Mother Mercury Mercury
Look what they've done to me
I cannot run, I cannot hide
La la la la la la la la la la la la




SONG 96
KEEP YOURSELF ALIVE


Take off
I was told a million times
Of all the troubles in my way
Mind you grow a little wiser
Little better every day
But if I crossed a million rivers
And I rode a million miles
Then I'd still be where I started
Bread and butter for a smile
Well I sold a million mirrors
In a shopping alley way
But I never saw my face
In any window any day
Now they say your folks are telling you
Be a super star
But I tell you just be satisfied
Stay right where you are

Keep yourself alive, yeah
Keep yourself alive
Ooh, it'll take you all your time and money
Honey you'll survive

Ow

Well I've loved a million women
In a belladonic haze
And I ate a million dinners
Brought to me on silver trays
Give me everything I need
To feed my body and my soul
And I'll grow a little bigger
Maybe that can be my goal
I was told a million times
Of all the people in my way
How I had to keep on trying
And get better every day
But if I crossed a million rivers
And I rode a million miles
Then I'd still be where I started
Same as when I started

Keep yourself alive, come on
Keep yourself alive
Ooh, it'll take you all your time and money honey
You'll survive, shake

Ow
Keep yourself alive, wow
Keep yourself alive
Oh, it'll take you all your time and money
To keep me satisfied

Do you think you're better every day?
No, I just think I'm two steps nearer to my grave

Keep yourself alive, c'mon
Keep yourself alive
Mm, you take your time and take more money
Keep yourself alive
Keep yourself alive
C'mon keep yourself alive
All you people keep yourself alive
Keep yourself alive

It'll take you all your time and a money
To keep me satisfied

DOING ALL RIGHT


Yesterday my life was in ruin
Now today I know what I'm doing
Gotta feeling I should be doing all right
Doing all right

Where will I be this time tomorrow
Jump in joy or sinking in sorrow
Anyway I should be doing all right
Doing all right

Should be waiting for the sun
Looking round to find the words to say
Should be waiting for the skies to clear
There a time in all the world
Should be waiting for the sun
And anyway I've got hide away

Ah ah ah ah
Yesterday my life was in ruin
Now today God knows what I'm doing
Anyway I should be doing all right
Doing all right

SONG 99
SON AND DAUGHTER


I want you 
Woman

Tried to be a son and daughter rolled into one
You said you'd equal any man for having your fun

Ooh, now didn't you feel surprised to find
The cap just didn't fit?
The world expects a man
To buckle down and shovel shit
What'll you do for loving
When it's only just begun?
I want you to be a woman

Tried to be a teacher and a fisher of men
An equal people preacher
Will you lead us all the same?

Ooh, well I travelled around the world
And found a brand new word for day
Ooh, watching the time mustn't linger behind
Pardon me I have to get away
Ooh, what'll you think of heaven
If it's back from where you came

I want you to be a woman
I want you to be a woman, yeah

Ooh, you know I'm gonna save the world
Ooh, now I've just begun
Alright
